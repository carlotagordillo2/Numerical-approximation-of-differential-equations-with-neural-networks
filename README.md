In this repository you can find codes for solving edps and edos by neural networks.

First, the problems have been approximated through an interpolation or adjustment. As in the case of a simple edo and systems such as the Prey-Predator model and SIR.

Finally, ODE's and PDE's have been solved through PINNs (Physics-Informed Neural Networks). As is the case of a simple ODE, SIR model and the heat equation.
